Age and Gender Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains a Python-based web application for age and gender detection using deep learning techniques. The application utilizes pre-trained neural network models to predict the age and gender of individuals in uploaded images. While the age prediction is approximately accurate, the gender prediction may exhibit some inaccuracies.

Key Features
Upload images and get real-time predictions for age and gender.
Utilizes deep learning models for accurate age and gender predictions.
Web interface for easy interaction and visualization.
Customizable confidence threshold for face detection and predictions.
Handles multiple faces in an image.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Django development server using python manage.py runserver.
Access the web application through your browser at http://localhost:8000/.
How It Works
The project involves two main tasks: age prediction and gender prediction. For age prediction, the model categorizes age intervals (e.g., 0-6, 18-25) while gender prediction classifies as male or female.

The project employs pre-trained models to detect faces, predict age, and determine gender. Images are processed, and face detection is performed using OpenCV's DNN module. The predictions are then displayed with bounding boxes on the uploaded image.

Please note that while the age prediction is relatively accurate, gender prediction may have occasional inaccuracies due to factors like image quality, lighting conditions, and background.
